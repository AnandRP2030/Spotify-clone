# Spotify Clone Using React.js and Chakra UI

### Are you a music enthusiast who loves listening to your favorite tracks on Spotify? If yes, then youâ€™re in for a treat! Recently, I and my team collaborated on building a Spotify clone using the latest tech stacks

## Live: https://spotify-clone4me.netlify.app/

## Tech Stacks Used

### 1 React JS
### 2 React-Router-DOM
### 3 Chakra UI
### 4 react-auth
### 5 react-h5-audio-player
### 6 React-Credit-Card-Validator
### 7 Firebase
### 8 Rapid API
### 9 Framer-Motion

### We wanted to create an application that not only replicates the functionality of Spotify but also adds some cool new features that users would love. Our Spotify clone has a dynamic homepage, search page, lyrics-library page, create playlist page, and liked song page, making it a complete music experience.
